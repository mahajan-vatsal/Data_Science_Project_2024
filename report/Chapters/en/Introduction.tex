\section{Introduction}

The focus of this analysis is to identify and mitigate potential threats and weaknesses within Orgadataâ€™s SimplyTag system. SimplyTag facilitates quick access to construction-related data through a web app, making it essential to safeguard against malicious actors attempting to exploit the system. This involves analyzing logs to detect suspicious activity and ensure data integrity.
