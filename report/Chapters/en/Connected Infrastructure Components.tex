\chapter{Connected Infrastructure Components}

\section{Infrastructure Integration}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{SimplyTag API Backend:} Serves as the primary source for log data. It collects and provides detailed information about HTTP requests, including trace IDs and status codes, for analysis.
	\item \textbf{Orgadata’s Logikal System:}Acts as the operational backbone for data-driven decision-making. This system contextualizes log data by linking it with construction-related project details, enabling precise threat detection.
	\item \textbf{External Threat Detection Tools:} To enhance the analytics, integration with external tools such as SIEM platforms or advanced machine learning models for threat prediction can be implemented. These tools offer additional layers of analysis and improve overall system resilience.
	\item \textbf{Cloud Infrastructure:} SimplyTag leverages cloud infrastructure to ensure scalability and reliability. The cloud platform supports large-scale log storage and computational power required for real-time analytics.
	\item \textbf{Mobile and Web Interfaces:} The analytics extend to user-facing interfaces like the SimplyTag mobile and web apps, ensuring seamless user interaction while maintaining robust security measures.
\end{itemize}

By connecting these components, the analytics create a comprehensive security ecosystem that is robust, scalable, and aligned with Orgadata’s operational goals.

\chapter{Positioning Within Standard Reference Architectures}

This solution aligns with several modern frameworks and architectures:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Smart-City:} The analytics align with secure data handling standards in urban development contexts, ensuring efficient and secure information exchange in large-scale urban projects..
	\item \textbf{IIoT/IIRA:} The approach supports reliability and security within industrial systems, adhering to frameworks like the Industrial Internet Reference Architecture (IIRA) for seamless integration and operational consistency, refer figure ~\ref{RAMI_IIRA}.
	\item \textbf{RAMI 4.0:} Within the Reference Architecture Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0), the analytics are positioned in the \SHELL{"Information Layer"}, where data processing, analysis, and anomaly detection occur. It also contributes to the "Functional Layer" by enabling actionable insights and decision-making based on real-time monitoring, refer figure ~\ref{RAMI_IIRA}.
	\item \textbf{ISO Standards Compliance:} The analytics are developed in alignment with international standards such as ISO 27001, ensuring robust security practices and data protection.
	\item \textbf{Cybersecurity Frameworks:} Incorporating principles from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, the analytics bolster detection, prevention, and response mechanisms for threats.
\end{itemize}
