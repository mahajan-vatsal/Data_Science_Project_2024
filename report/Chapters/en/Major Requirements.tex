\chapter{Major Requirements}

\section{Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Structural:} The analytics must seamlessly integrate with existing SimplyTag and Orgadata infrastructure.
	\item \textbf{Behavioral:} Real-time anomaly detection with high accuracy and minimal false positives.
	\item \textbf{Functional:} Efficient parsing of HTTP status codes and trace IDs to identify suspicious activity.
	\item \textbf{Technological:} Implementation of advanced algorithms for log analysis and anomaly detection.
\end{itemize}
  
This structured approach ensures that the Threat and Weakness Analysis for Orgadataâ€™s SimplyTag system is robust, effective, and well-positioned within industry standards.
