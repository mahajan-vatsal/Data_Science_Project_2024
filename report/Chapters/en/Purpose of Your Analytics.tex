\chapter{Purpose of Your Analytics}

\section{What It Does:}

This project belongs to the Industry domain, specifically the Construction Software sector, with a focus on:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Condition Monitoring:} Tracks HTTP requests in real-time to identify anomalies. This includes analyzing user agents and status codes to pinpoint irregularities that could indicate potential breaches or vulnerabilities.
	\item \textbf{Prevention:} Identifies and blocks malicious requests before they lead to breaches. Proactive security measures ensure that sensitive data and system integrity remain uncompromised.
	\item \textbf{Diagnosis:} Conducts post-incident analysis to refine future detection capabilities. By learning from past incidents, the analytics evolve to handle emerging threats more effectively.
	\item \textbf{Optimization:} Enhances system performance by ensuring secure operations without disrupting user experience. This involves balancing security measures with system usability, especially in high-demand environments like construction software solutions.
\end{itemize}
